## Challenges Faced

I had a hard time pushing my code to GitHub because I kept facing errors related to my local changes not matching what was online.

## Learning Outcomes

From this lab activity, I learned the critical importance of a structured workflow in version control, specifically mastering the sequence of fetch, pull, commit, and push commands to maintain synchronization.
